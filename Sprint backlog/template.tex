\section{SCRUM}

The agile software development framework chosen for the project was the SCRUM method. This method was chosen because it is lightweight, simple to understand and easy to use. Scrum will be used to address complex problems, increase productivity and deliver a unique solution. An iterative process will be followed where one team is responsible for the front-end and the other team is responsible for the back-end. The process will be iterative whereby the front end team will develop the web pages and the back-end team will then link these pages to the server. It will also be assumed that product specifications will remain constant for the prototype phase with any changes been added after the development of the prototype

\subsection{The project chart}
The various components of the project chart is described in the introduction of this document.

\subsection{Sprint retrospective}

The project consisted of 3 sprints which lasted 1 week each. This consisted of two daily meetings that happened on a Monday and Friday of each sprint. \\

Sprint 1: 21 March \textemdash  27 March\\\\
This sprint goal was to achieve the first 5 (Element 1-5) tasks on the sprint backlog.  These tasks were completed in time with a few adjustments. In element 1, forms for clients to create their accounts was removed and added as a server task instead. The user accounts are manually stored on the database for the prototype stage. The account creation page will now be done once CourierJZ approves the prototype design as this page may lead to developer complications.  In element 4, no form for the pickup location was added since it will be stored in the user's profile and thus simplify the act of sending a package.\\

Sprint 2: 28 March \textemdash 3 April\\\\
This sprint goal was to achieve elements 6\textemdash10 on the sprint backlog. Only tasks 7\textemdash9 were completed. This was due to the complexity of element 10 and the programmers time being limited by other commitments. For element 6 the payment management system was not implemented due to it not being an integral part of the prototype system. The information about the user's payment details (i.e. Credit card details) will now be stored in the users profile when implemented, this will make the process of sending a package simpler as the card details will not need to be entered each time as in is saved on the database.\\

Sprint 3: 4 April \textemdash 10 April\\\\
This was the last sprint for the prototype stage. For this cycle elements 10\textemdash16 needed to be completed for the last sprint. From element 10, the route assignment algorithm was not implemented. This is because the developers decided to focus on one algorithm (packing algorithm) due to time constraints. During the prototype stage, for simplicity the developers decided to only implement one driver profile, so there was only one route determined, therefore the page for drivers to pick routes was not necessary. For element 12, the check list was replaced by a submit button for each user. This was done so that when items were ticked, they could not mistakenly be unticked in the delivery process. Element 13 and 14 were removed from the list because the shortest distance algorithm was not implemented, so delivery times could not be correctly assigned for each package. Element 15 and 16 were combined into a receiver page with the relevant details being accessible by inputting the tracking ID into the receiver dashboard.\\

It can be seen from Figure 1.1 that in the beginning of the developmental process of the prototype,the project was on track. However towards the end, the actual work that was being performed was not meeting the targets. This could be because the work that needed to be performed was underestimated and therefore time was not allocated correctly. Care must be taken to ensure that these task are completed in the nearby future, otherwise the project has a high risk of not being completed in time.
